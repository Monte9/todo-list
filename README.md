## Motivation

It's been over 2 years since I built an iOS app and a lot has changed in the iOS ecosystem since then. For instance, I have an app on the App Store called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/typs/id1145048452" style="font-weight: bold">typs</a> which was written in Swift 1. And when I tried to open it in Xcode 9, it woudn't even build the app successfully.

Hence I decided to referesh my knowledge and learn how to build a simple To-do list app from scratch in iOS 11 & Swift 4.

## Course

I found [this](https://www.udemy.com/ios-swift-build-a-to-do-list-app) really short and helpful course on Udemy that walks you through how to build a to-do list app.
